I&amp;rsquo;ll start out by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of this book. I was warned before reading that it isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone and I&amp;rsquo;ll have to agree with that statement now. If not for the ease of reading, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would of completed it.
The book revolves around the idea of being completely consumed by your goals in life. This means ignoring criticism/negative feedback from anyone, putting in extra hours all the time, being ruthless towards your competitions and squeezing out every last drop of profit from your employees and clients.</description></item></channel></rss>
